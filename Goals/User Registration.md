# User Registration

User registration will be initially limited to organizers who will be verified manually by project administrators.  Organizes will be able to bulk import contacts which in turn will have the ability to register.

In short, all user registration will have to be initiated by verified organizers.

Long-term, registration will be opened to the public.
