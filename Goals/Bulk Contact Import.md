# Bulk Contact Import

Organizers will be able to bulk import contacts from a CSV.  It will require, at minimum, a first name, last name, and an e-mail address.  People who are imported into the database will have the ability to register with the e-mail address they provided their organizer, at which point they will have to fill out additional required fields for their user account, as well as `dateOfBirth` in order to establish a control hash.

Longitude and Latitude will be calculated from as much address information as is provided.  If no address information is given, longitude and latitude will not be available.  If a lot is given, precise locations will be determined for regional action organizing.
